First of all, we are grateful that we were able to work on this Project in IEM-Hacks 2025.

MISSION: With so many hospitals being crowded with patients and scarcity of Professional doctors or they only being available to the rich people, our website aims to bring help regarding common diseases that occurs to general people in day to day life. Our website "Nutricare++" can help you prepare a healthy diet according to your preference whether you are vegetarian or 
non-vegetarian. You can also track your calory intake (per 100gm).

FUTURE SCOPE:- In future we intend to introduce image recognition of foods to know how much calory it contains (approximately) and it will also tell the user whether it is good for user's health or not regarding their current health condition.

VISION: To eradicate health issues and its cure only being available to wealthy people.
